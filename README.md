# radiomics_research

In this research, I used this github library from https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch. In the train.py file, I modified the pytorch pipline to fit the NifitiGenerator for medical image processing. I then used the library to do segmentation on MSK dataset in cnnradiomics.ipynb file. Lastly, I used the encoder portion to extract features in analysis.ipynb file.
